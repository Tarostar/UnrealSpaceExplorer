Unreal C++ Coding
=================

Repo for tracking and backing up my experimental Unreal C++ coding.

# Aim

The purpose is to get to know the Unreal C++ framework and learn all the basics such as camera work, player control, HUDs, interaction, multiplayer and AI.

Level design and content such as meshes will not be committed and so while the source may be educational it is not a complete project. However, if you wish to plug this source into your own project then starting with the Unreal Code Flying (C++) template project is the best starting point. Naming it SpaceExplorer will make the integration much easier.

You will need of course to assign inputs which may look something like this:

# Blueprints

Some blueprints are committed, but will generally be based on C++ custom classes so that the underlying code can easily be modified. Such as the CustomHud class which is the basis for the blueprint HUD.

The C++ classes will generally be exposed to blueprints for easy in-editor tweaks.
