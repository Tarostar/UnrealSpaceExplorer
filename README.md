Unreal C++ Coding
=================

Repo for tracking and backing up my experimental Unreal C++ coding.

# Aim

The purpose is to get to know the Unreal C++ framework and learn all the basics such as camera work, player control, HUDs, interaction, multiplayer and AI.

Level design and content such as meshes will not be committed and so while the source may be educational it is not a complete project. However, if you wish to plug this source into your own project then starting with the Unreal Code Flying (C++) template project is the best starting point. Naming it SpaceExplorer will make the integration much easier.

You will need of course to assign inputs which may look something like this:

# Blueprints

Blueprints may also be used, but may not be included here. The C++ code should eventually be exposed to blueprints, but this is not the immediate priority.
